<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I’m a master’s student in Geographic Information Science at the University of Zurich, and an incoming PhD student in Geography at the University at Buffalo. My research bridges **human mobility**, **urban dynamics**, and **geospatial AI**, with a special interest in **transportation resilience under extreme events**. I enjoy working with large-scale mobility data, satellite imagery, and machine learning models to understand cities from both physical and behavioral dimensions.

My recent work focuses on quantifying multimodal mobility resilience during Hurricane Ida in NYC. I’ve also conducted research on DEM reconstruction, dengue and meteorological interactions, and urban growth via satellite imagery.
