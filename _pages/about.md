<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a master's student in Geographic Information Science at the University of Zurich and an incoming PhD student at the University at Buffalo. My research focuses on urban mobility resilience, disaster response, and spatial modeling. My recent thesis develops a framework to quantify how transportation diversity enhances human mobility resilience during Hurricane Ida in New York City. I use deep learning for baseline construction, resilience metrics, and spatial econometrics including MGWR.

I also worked on DEM reconstruction from terrain features using GANs, dengue-meteorology modeling, and urban building growth analysis with Planet imagery.

My research combines GIS, machine learning, and remote sensing to tackle real-world urban and environmental problems.
